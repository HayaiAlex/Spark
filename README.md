Welcome to Spark. A twitter clone with a catch, emojis only! ðŸ’¥

Through this project I am learning C#, ASP.NET, and how to build and use pipelines to host and deploy projects for production using Azure.
Currently, both the front and back-end are independly hosted on Azure services and will automatically redeploy when changes are made to the production builds. 

Although in its early stages I plan add user profile pages, liking posts, and a strong set of tests using JEST to create an impressive full-stack app.
